Lemmego is a platform that puts people in control of creating experiences where they can share ideas and enjoy each other's company. It requires everyone involved to be honest and involved.

Freevent
 - under 100 attendees
 - focus on human connection and sharing ideas 
 - discussions are lead by a speaker (interactivity varies)
 - publisher drives environment, flow, activities, schedule, meals
 - speaker suggests, develops and delivers talk
 - attendees comment and vote on talks before, during and after
 - publisher decides which talks are approved/confirmed
 - no registration fee for attendees
 - speakers speak for free and incur all of their own expenses
 - publishers can partner with sponsors to pay for speakers, meals, socials
   - but the site doesn't manage any of these transactions
